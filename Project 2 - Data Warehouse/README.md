<h1>Sparkify Data Modeling Project</h1>

<h3>Project Background</h3>
<p>A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app..</p>

<p>As their data engineer, you are tasked with building an ETL pipeline that extracts their data from S3, stages them in Redshift, and transforms data into a set of dimensional tables for their analytics team to continue finding insights in what songs their users are listening to. You'll be able to test your database and ETL pipeline by running queries given to you by the analytics team from Sparkify and compare your results with their expected results.</p>




<h3>Project Description</h3>
<p>In this project, I have defined fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus. I Launched a redshift cluster and created an IAM role that has read access to S3. In addition, I Implemented the logic (ETL pipeline) to load data from S3 to staging tables on Redshift and to load data from staging tables to analytics tables on Redshift.</p>



<h3>Datasets</h3>
<h5>Song Dataset</h5>
<p>The first dataset is a subset of real data from the Million Song Dataset. Each file is in JSON format and contains metadata about a song and the artist of that song. The files are partitioned by the first three letters of each song's track ID.</p>

<h5>Log Dataset</h5>
<p>The second dataset consists of log files in JSON format generated by this event simulator based on the songs in the dataset above. These simulate app activity logs from an imaginary music streaming app based on configuration settings.</p>

<h3>Project Used Files</h3>
<ol>
<li>create_table.py is where the creation of the fact and dimension tables for the star schema in Redshift will occur.</li>
<li>sql_queries.py is where wel define the SQL statements, which will be imported into the two other files above.</li>
<li>etl.py is where the loading of data from S3 into staging tables on Redshift will occur and then processing that data into your analytics tables on Redshift.</li>
<li>README.md provides discussion on the project.</li>
<li>LaC.ipynb is an "Infrastructure as code" script that will create our infrastructure for this project</li>
</ol>

<h3>Database Schema </h3>

<p>Using the song and log datasets, I used to create a star schema optimized for queries on song play analysis. This includes the following tables.</p>

<img src="Song_ERD.png" alt="ER" width="5000" height="6000">

<h5>Fact Table</h5>
<ol>
<li>songplays - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong</li>
<ol><ul>songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent</ul></ol></ol>

<h5>Dimension Tables</h5>
<ol>
<li>users - users in the app</li>
<ol><ul>user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level</ul></ol>
<li>songs - songs in music database</li>
<ol><ul>song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration</ul></ol>
<li>artists - artists in music database</li>
<ol><ul>artist_id, name, location, latitude, longitude</ul></ol>
<li>time - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units</li>
<ol><ul>start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday</ul></ol></ol>

<h3>ETL Pipeline</h3>
<p>This file etl.py contains all the ETL Pipeline code for each table. Thus by running this file, user will be able to load the data from Datasets to the tables.</p>
